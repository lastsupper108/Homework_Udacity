We were getting little or no improvement because we 
were wrong in bias calculation.

Instead of :           
bias = tf.Variable(tf.ones([64]))
we used:
bias = tf.Variable(tf.ones(64)) 

 missing brace has cost us hell lot of computing power cause it added bias to each pixel rather than 
 output of convolution.
